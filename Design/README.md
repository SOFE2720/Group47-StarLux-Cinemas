# Overview

This folder consists of all the behavioural, class and component models that were designed for this application, as well as initial prototypes.
<br></br>
The **Prototypes folder** includes several mockups that were created prior to the creation of the website. 
>There are two mockups for the main page, and one each for the food and drinks page, seat booking page and theatres page.
>
The **Class Diagram** showcases the primary classes of this application and the relationships between them. It provides an abstract, object-oriented model with the specific class attributes, methods and types. 
<br><br>
The details of the interaction flow sequence among system components are shown through the **Class Level Sequence Diagram**.
>This diagram is made with reference to the Purchase Tickets User Scenario, which can be found in the Use Cases Folder -> User Scenario.
>
While progressing through the application, an actor will interact with several entities in the application. Each entity will respond differently to an event triggered by the actor. The states of these entities are demonstrated in the **State Model Diagram**, with the initial state being that the user is creating a new booking request.
<br></br>
To showcase the interaction design between the user and the system, a **System Level Sequence Diagram** was used. 
>This diagram is also made with reference to the Purchase Tickets User Scenario.
