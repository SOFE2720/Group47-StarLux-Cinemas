# StarLux-Cinemas
## Introduction
StarLux Cinemas is a web-based application that can be accessed with an Internet connection and browser. Customers have the ability to view the movies playing at several locations, dates and times. They can select a movie preference by further exploring the plot description, cast, IMDB rating, and more. When continuing to the book tickets feature, the customer will be required to login or sign up to the system followed by an email confirmation. Once the customer has signed in, they may select their desired seat(s) and proceed to the checkout page where they can purchase their tickets. An order summary will be sent to the customerâ€™s email address to verify their booking. All customer details will be stored securely in a database to ensure data integrity. The aim for this software product is to reduce latency and complexity of in-person ticket purchasing by maximizing the efficiency of technology.
### Vision Statement
Our vision is to increase efficiency by reducing wait time for purchasing tickets at physical theater locations. Creating a user-friendly interface with a minimalistic design for booking movie tickets facilitates an effortless interaction between the customer and our website, thereby increasing customer retention.
